Shapiro spatial
---------------

The spatial shapiro model which is invoked by the isha/shapiro_wrapper resides in a subversion
repository at the moment. You need to add a working copy to RAMSIS first. To check out the
working copy cd to this directory then use these commands from the stone-age of version
control:

svn co https://svn.seismo.ethz.ch/svn/shapiro-spatial/trunk shapiro_spatial
