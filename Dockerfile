# Creates a RT-RAMSIS core production image
#
# To run the ramsis GUI, make sure there is a display available to the
# when the app is launched. Since this is platform specific, it's best to
# inject the DISPLAY env var from the command line when starting the container
# (and mount the X11 server socket when on a linux host).
#
# Also, since the docker container doesn't have access to the users ssh agent,
# we need to incect gitlab credentials via GITLAB_USER and GITLAB_PASSWORD
# ARGs so that we can access private repositories. We use a multi-stage build
# so that access credentials aren't carried over to the final image.
